So let's pick up what we were saying. We've considered kimi antonelli, but for georeg russell, what a season. One of the most consistent performers, finishing every race.

I think it was all but two laps, but he's just, Ithink he's come of age again, coming back to that,coming of age as a driver but as a potential world champion, he weill have been gritting his teeth, but saying, well done,Lnado, thanks very much, but I beat you coming up , and now next year could be my turn,and it could very  well be, but how do you rank his season?

I thik it was outstanding, reallyy outstanding. He maximized the opportunityies when there was low-hanging fruit. the only two chances, mercesdes had to win a race, and he won them, and he took them, and you can't trust that ferrari, for example, in hungary threw it away.

He got more than double the points of kimi antonelli, which is incredible, considering, I know was a rookie teammate, but still, again, more than double the points of your teammate is a big achivement. 24.5 in qualifying. And I just don't think he made any mistakes. He had a coupe of weekends, Miami and Brazil, maybe, where he was a bit behind antonelli.

And Abu Dhabi, you could say as well, he lost.

No, but he was ahead of antonelli, It was only those two weekends, wasn't it, you know, you've seen behind. So to me, that's a driver who's maximized the package that they've had below them.

And then he was unlucky in mexico
