Speaker 4: So let's pick up what we were saying. We've considered Kimi Antonelli, but for George Russell, what a season. One of the most consistent performers, finishing every race.
我们接着刚才的话题。我们已经讨论过Kimi Antonelli了，但对George Russell来说，多么精彩的一个赛季。他是最稳定的车手之一，完成了每一场比赛。

Speaker 4: I think it was all but two laps, but he's just, I think he's come of age again, coming back to that, coming of age as a driver, but as a potential world champion, he will have been gritting his teeth, but saying, well done, Lando, thanks very much, but I beat you coming up, and now next year could be my turn, and it could very well be, but how do you rank his season?
我记得好像只差两圈就全程跑完了。不过我觉得他作为车手又一次“成熟起来”了，也作为一个潜在的世界冠军。他可能会咬着牙说：“干得好，兰多，非常感谢，”但同时心里在想：“不过我马上就要追上你了。”而现在，明年也许就该轮到我了，而且很可能确实如此。那么你们会如何评价他这个赛季？

Speaker 3: I think it was outstanding, really outstanding. He maximized the opportunities when there was low-hanging fruit. The only two chances, Mercedes had to win a race, and he won them, and he took them, and you can't trust that Ferrari, for example, in Hungary threw it away.
我认为这是一个非常出色的赛季，真的非常出色。他在有能够把握的机会时，他做到了极致。梅赛德斯全年只有两次真正有机会赢下比赛，而这两场他都赢了、也把握住了。你不能指望法拉利——比如在匈牙利，他们就把机会白白丢掉了。

Speaker 3: He got more than double the points of Kimi Antonelli, which is incredible, considering, I know he was a rookie teammate, but still, again, more than double the points of your teammate is a big achievement, 24-5 in qualifying. And I just don't think he made any mistakes. He had a couple of weekends, Miami and Brazil, maybe, where he was a bit behind Antonelli.
他拿到的积分是 Antonelli 的两倍还多，这真的很惊人。即便考虑到 Antonelli 是一位新秀队友，但积分翻倍依然是巨大的成就。排位赛方面是 24 比 5。而且我真的不觉得他犯过什么错误。也许只有迈阿密和巴西那两个周末，他稍微落后于 Antonelli 一点。

Speaker 4: And Abu Dhabi, you could say as well, he lost.
还有阿布扎比，你也可以说他失利了。

Speaker 3: No, but he was ahead of Antonelli. It was only those two weekends, wasn't it, you know, you've seen behind. So to me, that's a driver who's maximized the package that they've had below them.
不，但他仍然是在 Antonelli 前面。就只有那两个周末而已，对吧？在我看来，这就是一位把现有赛车套件能力最大化发挥出来的车手。

Speaker 1: And then he was unlucky in Mexico with everybody going off at the first corner, him feeling aggrieved about it, and finished seventh. So there is that frustration in there still with George, when things aren't quite going right, and some of the great radio messages, you know, the frustrations with his teams, the frustrations he sees Lando winning a championship before him that he might be a bit miffed about. But, you know, I think he knows his time is coming.
然后在墨西哥站，他其实也挺不走运的——一号弯大家都冲出赛道，他对此非常不满，最终只拿到第七名。
所以你能感觉到，George 身上依然有那种挫败感：当事情不太顺的时候，他会有一些非常“精彩”的无线电内容，对车队的沮丧，以及看到 Lando 比他更早拿到世界冠军，心里多少会有点不是滋味。但我觉得，他自己很清楚：他的时刻终究会到来。

Speaker 1: He knows how good he is. He knows he's ready to win races and championships. And when he gets in that position and he's ready to win a race, he does it so effortlessly, doesn't he?
他知道自己有多强，也知道自己已经准备好赢下比赛和冠军。而且当他真的处在那个可以赢的状态时，他做到这一切看起来是那么轻松，对吧？

Speaker 1: He's just, you think it's never in doubt. Safe hands russell, he's been great this year.
他就是那种，你会觉得胜利从没悬念。“稳健之手” Russell，今年他真的非常出色。

Speaker 4: When you think about George, you know how much preparation goes into it. He's one of those guys that leaves absolutely no stone left unturned, from a performance and race engineering perspective. He's one of the best, we understand, at equating what's in front of him in terms of graphs and data into pace on track.
当你谈到 George，就会意识到他为比赛做了多少准备。他是那种在性能和比赛工程层面，绝不会放过任何一个细节的人。
据我们所知，他是最擅长把数据、图表转化为赛道速度的车手之一。

Speaker 4: You must have loved that as an engineer.
作为工程师，你一定很喜欢这一点吧？

Speaker 2: Everyone loves a graph, I don't understand. But yeah, he does seem, you know, I've never worked with George, but he does seem very focused, if we want to put it that way. He sits down, he spends a lot of time, they all spend a lot of time with their engineers, but taking it in, he seems to understand a lot what's going on around him.
谁不喜欢图表呢，虽然我不太理解。不过是的，我从未和 George 共事过，但他看起来确实非常专注。他会坐下来，花大量时间和工程师一起分析——当然所有车手都会这样，但他真的能“吸收”进去，也非常清楚自己周围正在发生什么。

Speaker 2: And I think, when I look at drivers or listen to drivers, particularly when you're listening to their team radio, the drivers that really understand different regulations, what's going on with different cars on track, those are the ones that do the best. The people who can do the strategy for the guy ahead and the guy behind, they're the drivers that are going to go for it, and George is one of those.
而且我认为，当你去观察或倾听车手——尤其是听他们的车队无线电时，那些真正理解不同规则、理解赛道上不同赛车状况的车手，往往表现最好。
那些不仅能为自己制定策略，也能同时考虑前后车局势的车手，才是真正“会去争”的人，而 George 正是其中之一。

Speaker 2: And I think it's been interesting since Lewis has left the team, he just seems to have grown a lot, you know, like he can see it in how he holds himself, how he talks to us, how he's walking through the paddock, he's just like been fit to breathe, that I think he always felt a bit in the shadow before.
而且我认为有趣的一点是自从 Lewis 离开车队之后，他看起来成长了很多。
就好像你能从他如何站立、如何与我们交流、如何走在维修区里看出来——他整个人都更从容了，像是终于能自由呼吸一样。我觉得之前他一直多少活在阴影之下。

Speaker 2: And he knows that next year is a massive opportunity for that team and for him. So yes, he will be a little bit sad that Lando's done it before him, but he knows that his chance is coming.
而他也很清楚，明年对车队、对他本人来说，都是一次巨大的机会。所以，是的，他可能会有点遗憾 Lando 比他更早做到这一切，但他知道——自己的机会正在到来。

Speaker 4: Any questions from the floor on what's going on at Mercedes this year? Oh, you've got, yeah, Mike, come on. We'll come down here.
现场有没有关于今年梅赛德斯情况的问题？
哦，有的——Mike，来吧？我们过来。

Audience (Mike): Hi, it's Mike from Milton Keynes. Question I have would be, how much of a distraction off track would be the Max Verstappen contractual stuff that was clouding over the season? Does it impact a driver or does it motivate him to perform better?
你好，我是 Mike。我的问题是：赛季期间围绕 Max Verstappen 的合同传闻，在赛道之外会对车手造成多大的干扰？
这会影响他们的表现，还是反而激励他们跑得更好？

Speaker 3: Well, I think it was Austria where George, where George gave that line in the interview. I remember going back to TV compound.
我记得是在奥地利站，George 在采访里说了那句话。我当时回到电视转播区——

Speaker 1: To you.
对你说的。

Speaker 3: To me. Ted said, you've done it. You've done it. You've got the line. I said, I have no idea what you're talking about, Ted. It was essentially George admitting that, saying, Max, it's logical that Mercedes are talking to Max, etc.
对我。Ted 说：“你拿到了！你拿到了！你拿到那句金句了！”我说：“Ted，我完全不知道你在说什么。”大意就是乔治等于承认了：他说，“马克斯，让梅赛德斯去和马克斯谈是合乎逻辑的”，等等。

Speaker 3: You could sense I don’t know, frustration is the right word, or the annoyance, I think maybe that was still going on. I think it would have been a distraction. I don’t think he let it affect his on-track performance, but I’m sure it was annoying because, we’re getting it from his point of view, right? They brought in the wonder kid, he’s done everything right from his perspective, he’s delivering results.
你能感觉到那种情绪——也许不是愤怒，更像是烦躁。我认为这肯定是一种干扰，但我不觉得他让这件事影响了自己的赛道表现。
让我们设身处地的想想：他们引进了“天才新星”，而他自己明明什么都做对了、成绩也在交付。

Speaker 3: He's staying focused. He's grown to that team leader status that Bernie is saying. He's beating his teammate, and yet his job is being put in question.
他保持专注，已经成长为 Bernie 所说的那种“车队领袖”。他击败了队友，但同时，他的席位还不能被保证。

Speaker 3:And you know, It must have been a difficult place to be, but I felt like he didn't let it affect his on-track performance.
能想象到他一定处于一个非常艰难的位置，但我觉得他没有让这件事影响自己的场上表现。

Speaker 2: Imagine it was like a relationship when someone says, I'm going to go out with you until that other guy comes available. That's basically what it is, isn't it? You're always sort of looking over your shoulder.
这就像一段感情关系：有人对你说，“我先和你在一起，直到那个人空出来。”
本质上就是这样，对吧？你永远在回头张望。

Speaker 2: It's a bit like we discussed Max earlier. When he goes into any of the motorhomes and says he wants to drive, then someone's feeling a bit edgy about that, aren't they?
这有点像我们之前讨论 Max 的情况。
当他走进任何一支车队，说“我想在这开车”，总会让别人感到紧张，不是吗？

Speaker 1: Well, what? Do we think that George thinks that Toto loves Antonelli and Verstappen more than him?
呃——什么？我们真的觉得George认为，Toto 更喜欢 Antonelli 和 Verstappen，而不是他？

Speaker 2,3: Yeah.
是的。

Speaker 1: Oh, Wow. 
哦，哇哦。

Speaker 3: I mean, I think that's true.
我觉得这是真的。

Speaker 1: Okay. 
好吧。

Speaker 4: It is.
确实如此。

Speaker 4: Let that sink in.
让我们消化一下。
