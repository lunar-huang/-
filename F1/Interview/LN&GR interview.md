“Who was quicker?
To begin with, he was quicker. He was much quicker, actually. And he was doing pretty well.
Are you just saying that because they probably listened to this?
No, no, no. He was when he first started, when he first started, just reiterating that. We were racing with George, and at that point, we were nobody.
With George Russell we're talking about.
George Russell. And George was the guy. He was the champion. I don't know if he was the champion, but he was the guy winning races. He was a cool guy. 
If we ever got to racing, we're like, oh my god, we get to race. George overtook me today. He's so cool. And he was, yeah, that was how we started, not knowing anything.”
“It was just cool to be like on track with George Russell. And he was racing with them, and he did really well in a lot of the races, and I was always a lot further back. But he was, my brother's quite tall, six foot something.

“Was George Russell a mate back then? Or was he just who?
No, he was more the guy we looked up to.
No, you still don't be mates, I suppose, or not? I mean, can you remember having a barbecue with him?
Why would he be mates with me? I'm the guy in 15th place, and he's winning races. He's not going to want to be mates with me.
By the time we got to the end of karting, we were mates. The first few years we weren't. We didn't know him at all.
But then as we kind of took a few steps up, and he was racing abroad, and then I started racing abroad. Another Brit. Then you start to get to know him a bit more, and you speak.
Is he your best mate on the grid now?
George. Well, him, Alex, and...”
“The Brit pack.
Him and Alex, we just know well. We get along really well. Because of racing last year, and kind of going up in karting a little bit together.
But then on the side, obviously, Carlos and Max. Those are the group of guys that I speak to mostly. Max, because of doing all the sim racing.”

谁更快？
一开始是他更快。事实上他快得多。而且他当时表现得非常好。
你是不是因为他们可能会听到这个才这么说？
不不不。不是的。他是真的更快——我是说一开始，再重申一下，一开始的时候。我们那时是和 George 一起比赛的，而在那个阶段，我们还是无名小卒。
我们说的是 George Russell，对吧？
对，George Russell。George 就是“那个家伙”。他是冠军。我不知道他算不算冠军，但他确实是在赢比赛的那个人。
他是个很酷的家伙，如果我们哪天能跟他一起比赛，我们会想：“我的天啊，我们今天去参加比赛了。George 今天超了我，他太酷了。”
当时就是这种感觉，我们在刚开始的时候什么都不懂。

“能在赛道上和 George Russell 同场竞技本身就很酷。”他当时和他们（这里指的应该是lando的哥哥）一起比赛，而且在很多场比赛里都表现得非常好。而我通常都在很后面。

那时候你和 George Russell 是朋友吗？还是只是……？
不，他更像是我们仰望的那个人。

所以那时候你们也不算朋友吧？我是说，你记得自己和他一起BBQ过吗？
我为什么会和他是朋友？我是那个排在第 15 名的人，而他是在赢比赛的人。他不会想跟我当朋友。
到卡丁车生涯快结束的时候，我们才成了朋友。前几年完全不是，我们根本不了解他。
后来，我们自己取得了一些进展，他开始去国外比赛，然后我也开始去国外比赛。我们都是英国人。这时候你才开始慢慢了解他，开始聊天。

现在他是你在围场里最好的朋友吗？
George？嗯，他、Alex，还有……

英国帮。
对，他和 Alex ，我们很熟。我们很处得来。因为去年一起比赛过，而且在卡丁车阶段也算是一起往上升级过。
